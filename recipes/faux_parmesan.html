        It doesn't really taste like parmesan, but it's pretty tasty and another way to season things if you're looking for something different! Noodles and broccoli are my personal favorites. Recipe taken from <a href="https://www.forksoverknives.com">Forks Over Knives.</a>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>1 tbs salt-free seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix it all together... and that's it! I usually double the recipe and dump it all into a Mason jar, then just shake it up</li>
            <li>Enjoy! :)</li>
        </ol>
